DAtomic REalm for apache SHIro

Because why should SQL databases get to have all the fun?

## Installation

Don't. This is barely vaporware at this point.

## Usage

Again, don't. You could add it to your project dependencies, and
try to use it as a back-end for your security needs [behind Apache
Shiro] but that would be a truly awful idea at this point.

I'm just noodling at this point.
